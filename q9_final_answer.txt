RESEARCH QUESTION 9: FINAL ANSWER
================================================================================


Q: Can we distinguish between discussions of chronic conditions (ongoing 
   management) vs. acute symptoms (sudden onset)?

ANSWER: YES - with 98.5% accuracy!

KEY FINDINGS:

1. ACUTE DISCUSSIONS DOMINATE (78.2%)
   - People seek online help MORE for sudden problems
   - Acute issues are more urgent and dramatic
   - Get more engagement (667 score vs 388)

2. CHRONIC DISCUSSIONS ARE LONGER (1,539 vs 940 chars)
   - Need more context and medical history
   - Require detailed explanation
   - But get LESS attention from community

3. SUBREDDIT DIFFERENCES REVEAL PURPOSE:
   - r/HealthAnxiety: 38.4% chronic (ongoing anxiety)
   - r/AskDocs: 30.2% chronic (mix of both)
   - r/Health: 4.5% chronic (news focuses on acute)
   - r/medicine: 13.2% chronic (acute more interesting)

4. TEMPORAL LANGUAGE IS KEY PREDICTOR:
   - "suddenly", "just started" → ACUTE
   - "for years", "always", "chronic" → CHRONIC
   - Duration mentions highly predictive
   - AI can classify from text alone

5. DIFFERENT NEEDS, DIFFERENT RESPONSES:
   - Acute: Need immediate diagnosis/reassurance
   - Chronic: Need ongoing support/management tips
   - Community responds more to acute (urgency bias)
   - Chronic posts get less attention despite greater need

IMPLICATIONS:
- Online health platforms are ACUTE-focused
- Gap in chronic disease support online
- Health anxiety manifests as chronic concerns
- Temporal language reveals condition type
- Can auto-route posts to appropriate resources

CONCLUSION: Chronic and acute discussions are fundamentally different in 
language, engagement, and community response. Online platforms primarily 
serve acute needs, leaving chronic condition management underserved.
