RESEARCH QUESTION 9: CHRONIC VS. ACUTE CONDITION DISCUSSIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can we distinguish between discussions of chronic conditions (ongoing 
   management) vs. acute symptoms (sudden onset)?

ANALYSIS PLAN:
================================================================================

PART 1: TEMPORAL LANGUAGE DETECTION
------------------------------------
Chronic indicators:
- Time phrases: "for years", "for months", "for weeks", "always", "constantly",
  "ongoing", "chronic", "persistent", "continuous", "long-term"
- Duration: "since [date]", "started X ago", "been dealing with"
- Frequency: "every day", "daily", "regularly", "all the time"

Acute indicators:
- Onset: "suddenly", "just started", "began yesterday", "this morning",
  "out of nowhere", "all of a sudden", "came on"
- Recent: "today", "yesterday", "last night", "few hours ago", "just now"
- Urgency: "emergency", "urgent", "immediate", "right now", "asap"

PART 2: CONDITION TYPE CLASSIFICATION
--------------------------------------
Known chronic conditions:
- Diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, asthma, COPD
- Depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD
- IBS, Crohn's, chronic pain, fibromyalgia
- Eczema, psoriasis, lupus

Known acute conditions:
- Flu, cold, infection, food poisoning
- Injury, fracture, sprain, cut, burn
- Allergic reaction, rash (sudden)
- Heart attack, stroke (emergency)

PART 3: TREATMENT-SEEKING PATTERNS
-----------------------------------
Chronic patterns:
- "How do you manage?"
- "What helps with?"
- "Living with"
- "Coping strategies"
- "Long-term treatment"
- "Lifestyle changes"

Acute patterns:
- "Should I go to ER?"
- "Is this serious?"
- "What could this be?"
- "Do I need antibiotics?"
- "When should I see a doctor?"

PART 4: EMOTIONAL DIFFERENCES
------------------------------
Chronic emotions:
- Frustration, exhaustion, resignation
- "tired of", "fed up", "can't take it anymore"
- Seeking support and validation

Acute emotions:
- Fear, panic, worry
- "scared", "worried", "terrified"
- Seeking immediate reassurance

PART 5: AI CLASSIFICATION
--------------------------
Features:
1. Temporal language score (chronic vs acute)
2. Condition type (if mentioned)
3. Urgency markers count
4. Duration mentions
5. Treatment-seeking language
6. Emotional tone
7. Post length (chronic = longer explanations?)
8. Question type

Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM
- BERT (if time permits)

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
================================================================================

By Subreddit:
- r/AskDocs: More ACUTE (seeking immediate diagnosis)
- r/HealthAnxiety: More CHRONIC (ongoing health worries)
- r/medicine: Mix (professionals discuss both)
- r/biohackers: More CHRONIC (managing/optimizing)

Engagement:
- Acute posts may get faster responses (urgency)
- Chronic posts may get more supportive comments
- Acute posts may have higher scores (dramatic)

Language:
- Chronic: Longer posts, more detail, medical history
- Acute: Shorter, more urgent, less context
- Chronic: Past tense ("have been")
- Acute: Present tense ("is happening")
