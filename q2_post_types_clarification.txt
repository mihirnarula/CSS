POST TYPE CLARIFICATION
================================================================================


The 17.6% represents posts with EXPLICIT self-diagnosis language patterns.
The other 82.4% includes:

1. INFORMATION-SEEKING (~8%)
   - General health questions
   - "What is X?", "How does Y work?"
   - Learning about conditions without personal diagnosis

2. ADVICE-SEEKING (~16%)
   - "Should I see a doctor?"
   - "What should I do about X?"
   - Seeking recommendations (not diagnosis)

3. PROFESSIONAL DISCUSSION (~13%)
   - Medical professionals discussing cases
   - Research and evidence discussion
   - Clinical practice questions

4. EXPERIENCE SHARING (~1%)
   - Sharing personal health journeys
   - Updates on treatments
   - Support and encouragement

5. IMPLICIT SYMPTOM DESCRIPTION (Remaining)
   - Describing symptoms WITHOUT diagnosis-seeking language
   - "I have these symptoms" (statement, not diagnosis attempt)
   - Symptom documentation

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Many posts describe symptoms but DON'T explicitly attempt self-diagnosis.
Example: "I have chest pain and shortness of breath" vs "I think I have a heart attack"
The first is symptom description, the second is self-diagnosis.

The 17.6% are posts where people are ACTIVELY TRYING TO DIAGNOSE themselves,
not just describing symptoms or seeking general information.
