Our project is titled “The Internet as a Doctor: How People Self-diagnose Online.”
 We aim to study how people use Reddit to interpret their symptoms, seek advice, and form self-diagnoses — essentially, how social media substitutes for medical consultation.




Self-diagnosis online involves:
Describing symptoms in posts
Asking others for opinions (“what could this be?”)
Searching online for conditions, treatments, and explanations
Using others’ experiences as informal medical advice
Reddit, with its pseudonymous and discussion-based structure, is an ideal platform to study this.




subreddit:
r/medicine: A large community for medical professionals discussing advances, news, controversies, etc.
r/AskDocs: A place to ask general health questions answered by verified doctors.
r/Health: Covers a wide range of health and wellness topics.
r/biohackers: Community for health optimization and biohacking enthusiasts.
r/medical: Questions about medical practices and procedures.
r/medicaladvice: For personal health questions and advice.
r/DiagnoseMe: Similar to AskDocs for medical questions.



We plan to explore:
How do people describe their symptoms and self-diagnose online?
What emotions (e.g., anxiety, fear, confusion) dominate these posts?
What kinds of health issues are most commonly self-diagnosed?
Can we use AI/NLP to automatically identify posts that represent self-diagnosis behavior?
