RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Project: "The Internet as a Doctor: How People Self-diagnose Online"
================================================================================

CORE RESEARCH QUESTIONS (10)

1. SYMPTOM DESCRIPTION PATTERNS
   Q: What are the most common symptoms people describe when seeking medical 
      advice online, and how do description patterns differ across subreddits?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Extract symptom keywords from posts/comments
   - Frequency analysis of symptoms by subreddit
   - Linguistic patterns (descriptive vs. clinical language)


2. SELF-DIAGNOSIS BEHAVIOR IDENTIFICATION
   Q: Can we identify posts/comments that explicitly contain self-diagnosis 
      attempts (e.g., "I think I have...", "Could this be...?")?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Pattern matching for self-diagnosis phrases
   - Classification of self-diagnosis vs. information-seeking
   - Measure prevalence across subreddits


3. EMOTIONAL STATE ANALYSIS
   Q: What emotions (anxiety, fear, confusion, hope) dominate health-seeking 
      posts, and does emotional intensity correlate with response engagement?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Sentiment analysis on posts and comments
   - Emotion classification (anxiety, fear, confusion, etc.)
   - Correlation between emotion scores and engagement metrics


4. COMMONLY SELF-DIAGNOSED CONDITIONS
   Q: What health conditions or diseases are most frequently mentioned in 
      self-diagnosis contexts across different medical subreddits?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Extract disease/condition names using NER or medical ontology
   - Topic modeling to identify condition clusters
   - Frequency analysis by subreddit


5. RESPONSE QUALITY AND CREDIBILITY
   Q: Do highly upvoted responses contain more authoritative medical language 
      or references compared to low-scored responses?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Compare language patterns in high vs. low scored comments
   - Identify medical terminology density
   - Detect citations/sources in responses


6. TIME-TO-RESPONSE PATTERNS
   Q: How quickly do people receive responses to health queries, and does 
      urgency language in posts affect response time?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Calculate time between post and first comment
   - Identify urgency markers ("urgent", "emergency", "ASAP")
   - Correlation between urgency and response speed


7. INFORMATION-SEEKING VS. VALIDATION-SEEKING
   Q: Are people seeking new information or validation for a self-diagnosis 
      they've already made?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Classify posts: open questions vs. hypothesis confirmation
   - Identify phrases like "I already think..." vs. "What could this be?"
   - Measure proportion of validation-seeking behavior


8. SUBREDDIT FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES
   Q: How do user behaviors differ across subreddits (e.g., r/AskDocs vs. 
      r/DiagnoseMe vs. r/HealthAnxiety)?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Compare post/comment characteristics by subreddit
   - Engagement patterns (scores, response rates)
   - Language formality and medical terminology usage


9. CHRONIC VS. ACUTE CONDITION DISCUSSIONS
   Q: Can we distinguish between discussions of chronic conditions (ongoing 
      management) vs. acute symptoms (sudden onset)?
   
   Analysis needed:
   - Temporal language analysis ("for weeks", "suddenly", "always")
   - Condition type classification
   - Treatment-seeking vs. diagnosis-seeking patterns


10. MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION
    Q: Can we build a classifier to automatically detect posts that represent 
       genuine self-diagnosis behavior vs. general health discussion?
    
    Analysis needed:
    - Feature engineering (linguistic, engagement, temporal)
    - Train/test classification models (logistic regression, random forest, BERT)
    - Evaluate model performance and feature importance


================================================================================
SECONDARY/EXPLORATORY QUESTIONS

- Do users who post in multiple health subreddits show different patterns?
- What is the relationship between post length and response quality?
- Are there seasonal patterns in certain symptom discussions?
- How often do users receive contradictory advice in comments?
- What proportion of posts mention prior doctor consultation?
