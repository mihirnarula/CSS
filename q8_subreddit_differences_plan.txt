RESEARCH QUESTION 8: SUBREDDIT FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES
================================================================================

Q: How do user behaviors differ across subreddits?

ANALYSIS PLAN:
================================================================================

PART 1: POST CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------------
For each subreddit, measure:
1. Average post title length
2. Average post body length (selftext)
3. Post type distribution (self-diagnosis, info-seeking, advice, discussion)
4. Symptom mention rate
5. Medical condition mention rate
6. Question vs. statement posts

PART 2: ENGAGEMENT METRICS
---------------------------
For each subreddit, measure:
1. Average post score (upvotes)
2. Median post score
3. Average number of comments per post
4. Response rate (% posts with at least 1 comment)
5. Average comment length
6. Comment depth (how nested are conversations?)
7. Time to first response

PART 3: LANGUAGE ANALYSIS
--------------------------
For each subreddit, measure:
1. Medical terminology density (% medical terms)
2. Readability scores (Flesch reading ease)
3. Formality level (professional vs. casual markers)
4. Emotional language (anxiety, fear, urgency markers)
5. First-person vs. third-person usage
6. Question density (questions per post)

PART 4: USER BEHAVIOR PATTERNS
-------------------------------
For each subreddit, analyze:
1. Self-diagnosis prevalence (from Q2)
2. Validation-seeking vs. information-seeking
3. Urgency markers ("urgent", "emergency", "help")
4. Follow-up behavior (do OPs respond to comments?)
5. Cross-posting (do users post in multiple subreddits?)

PART 5: TEMPORAL PATTERNS
--------------------------
For each subreddit, analyze:
1. Post frequency over time
2. Peak posting times (time of day, day of week)
3. Response time patterns
4. Seasonal trends

PART 6: COMMUNITY DYNAMICS
---------------------------
For each subreddit, analyze:
1. Top contributors (who comments most?)
2. Expert presence (verified professionals?)
3. Community support vs. medical advice
4. Conflicting advice rate

EXPECTED FINDINGS:
================================================================================

r/medicine:
- Professional language, high medical terminology
- Longer posts, more detailed
- Discussion-focused, not diagnosis-seeking
- High engagement from medical professionals

r/AskDocs:
- High self-diagnosis rate (63.3% from Q2)
- Question-heavy posts
- Seeking expert validation
- Moderate medical terminology (patients trying to sound medical)

r/HealthAnxiety:
- High emotional language (anxiety, fear, worry)
- Reassurance-seeking behavior
- Repeated similar concerns
- Community support focus

r/Health:
- General health topics
- Low self-diagnosis (1.9% from Q2)
- Information-sharing
- Casual language

r/biohackers:
- Experimental/optimization focus
- Technical language
- Data-driven discussions
- Self-experimentation reports

r/medicaladvice:
- Direct advice-seeking
- Urgent language
- Short, specific questions
- Low engagement (small community)

VISUALIZATION PLAN:
================================================================================
1. Heatmap: Engagement metrics by subreddit
2. Bar charts: Language characteristics comparison
3. Radar chart: Subreddit "personality" profiles
4. Box plots: Score and comment distributions
5. Time series: Activity patterns over time
6. Network graph: Cross-subreddit user behavior

TECHNIQUES TO USE:
================================================================================
1. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std)
2. Statistical tests (ANOVA, chi-square) for significance
3. Text complexity metrics (Flesch-Kincaid)
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Topic modeling (LDA) per subreddit
6. Clustering (do subreddits naturally group?)
