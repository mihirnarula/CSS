RESEARCH QUESTION 8: FINAL ANSWER
================================================================================


Q: How do user behaviors differ across subreddits?

ANSWER: User behaviors differ DRAMATICALLY across medical subreddits based on 
their primary goal:

1. DIAGNOSIS-SEEKING (r/AskDocs, r/medicaladvice)
   - Write long, detailed symptom descriptions
   - Use urgent language and many questions
   - Attempt self-diagnosis (63.3% in AskDocs)
   - Try to use medical terminology to sound credible
   - Anxious and concerned tone

2. PROFESSIONAL DISCUSSION (r/medicine)
   - Share knowledge and discuss cases
   - Use most medical terminology (1.72% density)
   - Highest engagement (1,359 avg score)
   - Mostly statements, not questions
   - Professional, solution-focused tone

3. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT (r/HealthAnxiety)
   - Seek reassurance and validation
   - Highest anxiety language (0.86 words/post)
   - Most subjective content (0.503 score)
   - Google symptoms and fear worst outcomes
   - Supportive community tone

4. NEWS/INFORMATION (r/Health)
   - Share health news and articles
   - Shortest posts (just headlines)
   - No personal health issues (1.9% self-diagnosis)
   - Focus on politics, outbreaks, public health
   - Neutral, informational tone

5. OPTIMIZATION (r/biohackers)
   - Experiment with supplements and lifestyle
   - Most positive sentiment (0.062)
   - Data-driven discussions
   - Focus on enhancement, not problems
   - Curious, experimental tone

6. QUICK ADVICE (r/medicaladvice)
   - Brief questions seeking immediate help
   - Highest question rate (62.8%)
   - LOWEST engagement (mostly ignored)
   - Desperate, worried tone
   - Small, inactive community

KEY INSIGHT: The same health topic generates completely different behaviors
depending on whether users seek diagnosis, support, knowledge, or optimization.
Machine learning can distinguish these communities with 79.8% accuracy based
purely on how people write.
